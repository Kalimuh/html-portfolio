<p> Its scintific fiction film.<br/> 
    It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually 
    a simulated reality called "the Matrix".<br/> It created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source.<br/> Computer programmer "Neo" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the "dream world". </p>
<h3> Face off</h3>
